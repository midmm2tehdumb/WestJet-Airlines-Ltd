    I: `<h2>Article I — Identity and Structure</h2>
<p>WestJet Airlines Ltd. is a virtual airline committed to realistic, professional, and engaging flight operations. Headquartered in Calgary (YYC), the airline operates across domestic, regional, and international routes using a fleet optimized for each type of flight.</p>

<p>The airline is organized into operational divisions, each with specific responsibilities to ensure smooth and safe operations. These divisions include Domestic Operations, Long-Haul Operations, Regional Operations, and Cargo Operations. Each division has designated managers overseeing planning, scheduling, and execution of flights within their area.</p>

<p>WestJet Airlines maintains strict operational standards. All flight routes are carefully planned to reflect realistic airline procedures, including correct aircraft type, route legality, and operational feasibility. Flight crews are expected to follow standard procedures in takeoff, en-route, and landing operations, even within the virtual simulator environment.</p>

<p>The airline also emphasizes documentation and reporting. Pilots and staff are encouraged to submit post-flight reports, flight logs, and operational feedback. This ensures continual improvement of processes, adherence to safety protocols, and maintenance of the highest standards in virtual airline management.</p>

<p>Additionally, WestJet Airlines invests in training and development for all members. New pilots receive orientation on aircraft systems, operational rules, and virtual airline etiquette. Experienced pilots have opportunities for advanced training, leadership roles, and participation in special operational exercises, such as international charters or emergency response simulations.</p>

<p>The airline's structure ensures that while operations are professional and realistic, members can enjoy the experience and develop their skills within a supportive community. This structure is the foundation upon which WestJet Airlines delivers a high-quality, immersive virtual aviation experience.</p>,


    II: `<h2>Article II — Mission and Vision</h2>

Our mission is to connect virtual communities, inspire aviation enthusiasts, and simulate real-world airline operations as accurately as possible within the GeoFS environment.

By providing comprehensive resources, realistic flight scenarios, and structured operational divisions, we seek to empower pilots and staff to achieve their full potential within the virtual airline world.</p>

<p>WestJet Airlines envisions a future where its virtual operations are recognized for their realism, attention to detail, and commitment to safe and ethical flight practices. We aspire to expand operational capabilities, integrate advanced flight planning techniques, and maintain a dynamic fleet that meets the needs of our expanding route network.

    III: `<h2>Article III — Governance and Leadership</h2>
<p>The governance of WestJet Airlines Ltd. is structured to ensure clear decision-making, operational efficiency, and accountability across all virtual flight operations.

Regional Managers oversee the day-to-day operations at major hubs, including Calgary (YYC), Toronto (YYZ), and Vancouver (YVR), guaranteeing that all flights adhere to realistic procedures and schedules.</p>

<p>Operational decisions, including flight approvals, route planning, and fleet deployment, are guided by structured protocols and standard operating procedures. The governance structure emphasizes transparency, with records of decisions, training logs, and operational reports maintained for accountability. Additionally, the leadership team conducts regular reviews of flight performance, pilot activity, and fleet utilization to ensure operational standards are met and to implement improvements where necessary.</p>

<p>WestJet Airlines Ltd. conducts all virtual flight operations with a commitment to realism, safety, and consistency. Flights are required to originate or terminate at approved destinations, following schedules and routes that mirror real-world airline practices. Each flight must utilize aircraft appropriate to the route, taking into account range, capacity, and operational requirements.</p>

<p>Cargo operations are identified by the WSX designator and are conducted using aircraft configured for freight transport. Pilots operating cargo flights must follow procedures consistent with professional cargo logistics, ensuring timely and accurate delivery of virtual shipments. Passenger flights, whether domestic or long-haul, adhere to flight planning and operational standards, including using simbrief (Or other flight plan creations) flightplans, adherence to air traffic control protocols (If present), and realistic in-flight procedures. (Such as a 250kt speed limit under 10,000ASL)</p>

<p>Operational standards include proper fuel planning, route compliance, and aircraft handling according to manufacturer specifications.

<p>Continuous monitoring, feedback, and training are integral to operations. The leadership team regularly reviews flight performance, pilot proficiency, and adherence to standards. Operational improvements are implemented based on performance data and community feedback to maintain high levels of professionalism and realism across all airline activities.</p>,

    VI: `<h2>Article VI — Branding and Representation</h2>
<p>The WestJet Airlines name, logo, and aircraft livery are official brand assets that represent the airline’s identity within the virtual flight community. All members are expected to uphold these brand standards in every activity, ensuring consistent and professional representation of the airline.</p>

<p>Members must not alter, modify, or misuse the WestJet logo, branding, or livery in any way. This includes social media posts, flight screenshots, or virtual liveries used in GeoFS or other flight simulators. Unauthorized modifications or misrepresentations of the airline may result in disciplinary action to protect the integrity and reputation of the airline.</p>

<p>Professional communication is essential for maintaining the airline’s public image. All official announcements, flight reports, and interactions with other virtual organizations must be conducted in a professional and respectful manner. Members acting on behalf of the airline, including pilots, crew, and staff, are ambassadors of the brand and must reflect its values of realism, safety, and professionalism.</p>

Each proposed amendment is reviewed carefully to ensure it aligns with the airline’s operational standards, mission, and values. Amendments may include updates to operational procedures, training requirements, or internal policies.</p>

<p>To be adopted, amendments require approval by a two-thirds (⅔) majority of the Executive Team. Once approved, the changes are documented and communicated to all members within 48 hours, ensuring transparency and consistency across the organization.</p>

<p>All members are encouraged to review amendments and provide feedback if necessary. Amendments are intended to improve airline operations, strengthen community engagement, and maintain professionalism throughout the virtual airline. Historical records of amendments are retained to provide a clear reference for past decisions and policy evolution.</p>

<p>This amendment process ensures that WestJet Airlines remains adaptive, organized, and responsive to the needs of its operations and members, while upholding the standards of safety, realism, and professionalism.</p>,

    VIII: `<h2>Article VIII — Enforcement and Interpretation</h2>

Enforcement actions are taken when members fail to adhere to operational standards, conduct policies, or branding guidelines.</p>

<p>All enforcement decisions are conducted transparently, with clear communication of the issue, expected corrective actions, and timelines for resolution. Disciplinary measures may include warnings, temporary suspension from operations, or removal from membership, depending on the severity and nature of the infraction.</p>

<p>Interpretation of this Constitution is guided by the principles of professionalism, realism, and safety in airline operations. The CEO’s interpretations are final, but all decisions are documented and made accessible to the Executive Team for review, ensuring accountability and fairness.</p>

<p>By maintaining a structured system of enforcement and interpretation, WestJet Airlines ensures that operational standards are consistently applied, fostering a professional, immersive, and enjoyable environment for all members.</p>,
