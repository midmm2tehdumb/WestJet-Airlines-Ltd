  IX: `<h2>Article IX - Elections and Campaigns</h2>
  <p>1. Admin may register their candidacy for an election by sending a DM to <strong>midmm2</strong> on the 10th of the month. All campaigning will stop 24 hours before the election begins at midnight, Mountain Standard Time, election day. Admin may only register their candidacy for one office at a time and if defeated in an election may register their candidacy for the upcoming elections in a general election cycle.</p>
  <p>1. Admin may register their candidacy for an election during or after the 24 hours if no other admin has registered.</p>

  <p>2. Campaigning is banned for the full 24-hour duration of all scheduled elections. Election day campaigning is defined as soliciting votes and sending out campaign telegrams to citizens. Soliciting votes is defined as contacting nations publicly or privately in order to convince them to vote for a certain candidate and advocating for a vote for their candidacy in the Chat or other discussion pages.</p>

  <p>1. Campaigns on election day result in the candidate being taken off the ballot and all votes for them nullified, along with being unable to run in any other potential contests during the next 3 months. If a non-candidate campaigns for a candidate on election day, they will receive an election ban for 1 cycle.</p>

  <p>2. If more than one candidate remains in the event of a candidate being removed from the ballot, the election will be rescheduled for another full 24 hours at the soonest possible time, and no longer than a day after the removal of the candidate. Election day campaigning is allowed during interim election campaigns, besides incentivizing citizens to vote for a certain candidate.</p>

  <p>3. All campaign materials and the candidate’s names are to be linked in a server-wide message to all members on election day, along with the election poll. This is to be replicated in a post as well. Campaign materials are the official campaign dispatches of all candidates or an official statement when provided by a candidate who lacks a campaign dispatch.</p>

  <p>3. Elections will be held every 3 months subject to change from <strong>midmm2</strong>.</p>

  <p>1. Elections for President will be held on the 30th.</p>
  <p>2. The Vice President will be appointed by the President, then voted to either stay or be replaced.</p>
  <p>3. Elections for other offices, if applicable, will be held on the fourteenth of these months.</p>

  <p>4. If there is only 1 candidate, that person automatically holds the office. If there are more than two candidates, the election will be decided via a two-round system, in which the top two candidates advance to a second round if no one wins 51% or more of the vote.</p>

  <p>5. All elections will last 24 hours with the second round being held the next day for 24 hours.</p>

  <p>4. If a tie occurs, the affected candidates will discuss how to resolve the tie.</p>

  <p>1. If within 16 hours of the election elapsing the affected candidates have not reached a consensus, then a game of random chance will be held by <strong>midmm2</strong> to determine the winner.</p>
  <p>2. Random chance games must be best out of 5 unless agreed otherwise.</p>
  <p>3. If <strong>midmm2</strong> is not present to administer the game live, then the game may be administered by another person agreed upon by the affected candidates; otherwise, the game will be delayed until he can administer it.</p>

  <p>5. After winning an election, admin who already hold an office must resign from their previous position to accept their new office if their term hasn't expired.</p>

  <p>6. If a scheduled election is not held on the date it is meant to be held, the election in question will be held the day after the error is first highlighted (Mountain Standard Time).</p>

  <p>7. <strong>midmm2</strong> can order an investigation into an election if he and 2 other members or admin provide evidence that suggests election manipulation. An absolute majority of the server members must confirm the order.</p>

  <p>1. Upon the order, the election is frozen and no new votes are counted.</p>
  <p>2. If it is proven beyond a reasonable doubt that election manipulation has taken place, the election is to be scrapped with the candidacy of the perpetrating person disqualified.</p>
  <p>3. If it is not proven beyond a reasonable doubt, the election resumes as normal.</p>
  <p>4. Reasonable doubt is defined as evidence that is factual and clearly defined such that any rational person would accept it.</p>

  <p>8. Bribery is strictly prohibited.</p>

  <p>1. Bribery is defined as any offer of a potential appointment in exchange for a vote, money, warning clearance, protection from bans, and other clear and definable instances of bribery determined by Mid and approved by the constitution.</p>
  <p>2. Members accused of bribery will be subject to an interrogation and, if found guilty, will receive a 1-year political ban. If the accused is a member of the Executive team, they will be subject to impeachment.</p>`,
